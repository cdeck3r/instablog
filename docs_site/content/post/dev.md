The instablog development utilizes a docker image with all tools installed.
This includes

* Python3 environment
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment
* Java
* [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) to quickly write UML diagrams
* [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generators

Development is controlled by a `Makefile`. There are quickstart instructions on the [instablog's Github repo]( https://github.com/cdeck3r/instablog)
