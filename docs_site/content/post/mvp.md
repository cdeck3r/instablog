The minimum viable product creates the initial value.

All Instagram posts of a *selected single date* shall be listed in a day's blog post on [DramaLamas.tours](//DramaLamas.tours). The blog post shall display the correct date. It shall contain for each Instagram post at least

* caption
* <s>date and time</s>
* image
* link from the image to Instagram post

**Note:** Instablog sources a profile's feed. Since the Instagram website shows only up 12 recent posts in a feed, the blog post is limited to those recent posts.

**Acceptance test**

The MVP is accepted if the functionality above is shown for at least two different dates.
