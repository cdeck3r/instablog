      <description>Existing solutions sharing instagram posts within a blog explicitly embedd an post URL. This is a manual effort one has to do for every new instagram post entry. The Instagram JavaScript plugin, Instafeed.js, utilizes Instagram&amp;rsquo;s API and retrieves new posts filtered by a user-defined function. As a result, a single blog post embedding this javascript would display a large list of Instagram post. However, it is unclear how a daily blog is generated which only contains the posts from that day.</description>
