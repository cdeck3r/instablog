All Instagram posts of a selected single date shall be listed in a day&amp;rsquo;s blog post on DramaLamas.tours. The blog post shall display the correct date. It shall contain for each Instagram post at least

 instacrawler.sh Defines the profile URL and the file storing posts&amp;rsquo; shortcodes as .csv file. Afterwards, it calls the python script to do the work. instacrawler.py Downloads the profile website, extracts the shortcodes and stores them in .</description>

      <description>Existing solutions sharing instagram posts within a blog explicitly embedd an post URL. This is a manual effort one has to do for every new instagram post entry. The Instagram JavaScript plugin, Instafeed.js, utilizes Instagram&amp;rsquo;s API and retrieves new posts filtered by a user-defined function. As a result, a single blog post embedding this javascript would display a large list of Instagram post. However, it is unclear how a daily blog is generated which only contains the posts from that day.</description>
